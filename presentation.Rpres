Overview
========================================================
In this presentaion the R dataset mtcars is used. 

A linear regression model is used to predict the miles per gallon for a car with selected properties.

The user can select the following:
- `Weight`
- `Gear`
- `Cylinder`

After input of the properties, a plot with regression line is created and will give a predicted miles per gallon of a car.

Data Set
========================================================

The data used for this application is mtcars that is available in R.

The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles.


```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(mtcars)

```

Shiny files
========================================================

The Shiny package is used when building this application.

The source code is in 2 files:
- `ui.R`
- `server.R`

You can find my files here at my Git Hub Repo:

Application
========================================================


The application shows a plot of the weight and miles per gallon, a regression line on the plot is also shown. 

The data set used is mtcars in R.

By selecting specific features of the cars
- `Weight`
- `Gear`
- `Cylinder`

the user can predict the miles per gallon and the regression is recalculated based on the cars that have the selected features. 

If there are no features selected the regression model will use all data.
